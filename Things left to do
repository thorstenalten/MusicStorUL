Some major and minor things we need to get done before meeting Annette. 

- Pretty much all pages are still missing header and footer
- Delete Page -> everything done except the actual deletion from the database
- Download Page -> everything done, but we're only simulating downloading the playlists (too much work to combine all songs and then send a big file to browser in the time left), downloading songs however works quite fine
- About Page (this is easy, just put in some text talking about the site)
- EditPlaylistPage -> not started yet, basic pattern is similar to Delete/Download page but someone needs to sit down and do this thing, it's used to both create and edit playlists
- Login page -> done, at most we need to change the cookies a bit if it becomes necessary otherwise complete
- MainPage -> halfway done, it links to all other pages, but I kicked out the player (and put it into MusicLibraryPage) still missing the comment section
- MusicLibrary Page -> halfway done, lists all music of user with option to play, however, can't play playlists yet since I can't figure out how to refresh the listbox responsible
- Profile+Edit Page -> done, except comments 
- Register Page -> done I think
- Song Info + Edit Page -> Will, what've you got?
- Upload Page -> almost nothing done yet
- we are missing the comment sections everywhere
- we are missing css (except some rudimentary on profile)
- we are missing test data in our database!
